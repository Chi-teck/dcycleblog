Often, during local development, we get the dreaded "Unable to send e-mail. Contact the site administrator if the problem persists."

This can make it hard to figure out problems related to how emails are sent in a local environment.

Enter Mailhog
-----

[Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) is a dummy SMTP server with a web GUI, which means you view all outgoing messages with a Gmail-type interface.

It is a major pain to install, but we can automate the entire process with the magic Docker.

Let's see how it works, and discuss after. Follow along by installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) -- **no other dependencies are required** -- and installing [a Drupal 8 starterkit](http://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site):

    git clone https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site.git
    cd starterkit-drupal8site
    ./scripts/deploy.sh

This will install a MySQL server with a starter database, a configured Drupal site, and Mailhog, on three different Docker containers. You wil see something like this at the end of the output:

If all went well you can now access your site at:

    => Drupal: http://0.0.0.0:32791/user/reset/...
    => Dummy email client: http://0.0.0.0:32790

Now, the magic
-----

You might be seeing different port numbers instead of 32791 and 32790, so use your own instead of the example ports.

* Visit http://0.0.0.0:32791/user/password
* Enter "admin" and submit
* Now visit http://0.0.0.0:32790

As you can see, all emails produced by Drupal are now visible on a cool GUI!

So how does it work?
-----

A dedicated "Mailhog" docker container, using on the [Mailhog Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mailhog/mailhog/) is defined in [our docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L5-L9). It exposes port 8025 which is mapped to a random unused port on the host computer (in the above example, 32790). Note that the 8025 port is for public GUI access, and port 1025 is the SMTP mailhog port [as you can see in the Mailhog Dockerfile](https://hub.docker.com/r/mailhog/mailhog/Dockerfile).

In the same docker-compose.yml, the "drupal" container (service) links to the "mail" service; this means that when you are inside the Drupal container, you can access Mailhog SMPT server "mail" and port 1025.

In the Starterkit's [Dockerfile](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/Dockerfile#L59), we download the [SMTP](https://www.drupal.org/project/smtp) modules, and in [our configuration](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/drupal/config/core.extension.yml#L36), we install SMTP (0, in this case, is the module's weight).

Next, configuration: because this is for local development, [we are leaving SMTP off in the exported configuration](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/drupal/config/smtp.settings.yml#L1), because in production we don't want SMTP to link to Mailhog. Then, in [our overridden settings](https://github.com/dcycle/starterkit-drupal8site/blob/master/drupal/settings/local-settings.php#L22-L31), we enable SMTP and set the server to "mail" and the port to 1025.

Now, you can debug sent emails in a very realistic way!
